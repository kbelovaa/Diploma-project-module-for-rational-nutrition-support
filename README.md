# Diploma project "Module for rational nutrition support"

Big request: don't look at the quality of the code, I know that in some places it leaves much to be desired! This project was very quickly remade from a very old one :)
Here I understood PHP code from scratch. And it was someone else's old code, which I understood and rewrote for myself :)

The application is designed to place an order for food delivery, as well as to calculate the user's calorie allowance and automatically generate a diet
